# Plant Identification Neural Network

## Overview

This project implements a neural network for identifying flower species using images. The neural network architecture consists of multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, to process and classify flower images effectively. The model is designed to leverage deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy in flower species recognition.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilizes convolutional layers for feature extraction from images.
- **Max Pooling**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining essential features, improving model efficiency.
- **ReLU Activation Function**: Employs ReLU for non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Softmax Output Layer**: Outputs probabilities for each flower species, allowing for multi-class classification.
- **Backpropagation**: Implements the backpropagation algorithm for weight updates during training.

## Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of the following layers:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts the image data as input.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple convolutional layers extract features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Hidden Layers**: Three fully connected hidden layers for further processing of the extracted features.
- **Output Layer**: Produces probabilities for each flower species using the softmax function.
